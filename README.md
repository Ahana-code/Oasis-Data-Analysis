FOR CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION:
What we are doing here is creating a new column called Segment that consist of this:
| Annual Income | Spending Score | Result    |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| >70           | >60            | Premium   |
| >70           | <40            | Careful   |
| <40           | >60            | Target    |
| <40           | <40            | Low Value |
| All others    | Other values   | Mid-range |

> Formula for the above will be:
=IF(AND(D2>70, E2>60), "Premium",
 IF(AND(D2>70, E2<40), "Careful",
 IF(AND(D2<40, E2>60), "Target",
 IF(AND(D2<40, E2<40), "Low Value",
 "Mid-range"))))


> X-axis â†’ Annual Income (k$)
> Y-axis â†’ Spending Score (1â€“100)

> Colored dots for each segment:
ğŸ”´ Target
ğŸ”µ Premium
ğŸŸ  Low Value
